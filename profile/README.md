## 🧠 What Is a Skin Changer in The Finals?

A **Skin Changer** is a cosmetic hack that injects or overrides in-game skin values so you can apply any appearance item—even if you don’t own it. You still play as normal, but to you (and sometimes others), your loadout and character look fully upgraded.

That means:

* Legendary outfits ✔️
* Rare weapon wraps ✔️
* Exclusive animations ✔️
* Preview unreleased skins ✔️

It’s like unlocking the entire cosmetics shop—without paying or grinding.
